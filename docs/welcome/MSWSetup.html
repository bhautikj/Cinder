		<h1>Windows Setup</h1>
		<p>Cinder on Windows is
		designed to use Microsoft Visual Studio 2010, and works with both the
		commercial version and the freely available <em>Express</em> editions. If you don't already have it installed, 
		you can download <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/#2010-Visual-CPP">Visual C++ Express here</a>.</p>
		<br>
		<p><b>Note to Visual Studio 2008/Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition Users:</b> The Cinder binaries are pre-built to work with VC++ 2010, but you can still easily use Cinder. You'll just need to rebuild the .lib files. To do this, simply open the cinder solution in the vc9 folder and build it under both the Debug and Release configurations.</p>
		<br>
		<p>If you are you using an Express edition of Visual C++ and you have
		never installed the Platform SDK, you'll want to do that too - just 
		<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=E6E1C3DF-A74F-4207-8586-711EBE331CDC&amp;displaylang=en">download and run the installer here</a>.</p>
		<br>
		<p>You'll need the DirectX SDK - <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=B66E14B8-8505-4B17-BF80-EDB2DF5ABAD4">Download the August 2009 version here</a>. You'll also need to tell Visual Studio how to find the DirectX header files. Select <b>Tools | Options</b> from the menu bar and find <b>VC++ Directories</b> in the <b>Projects and Solutions</b> group. Choose <b>Include Files</b> from the <b>Show directories for</b> dropdown list and click the New Folder icon. Enter <em>$(DXSDK_DIR)\include</em> and click OK.</p>
		
		<br/>

		<br/>
		
		<p>Lastly, you'll need to grab the <a href="https://connect.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MemberSite.woa/wa/getSoftware?bundleID=19910">QuickTime SDK 7.3 from Apple</a> which requires you to have a free ADC login. Cinder expects QuickTime to exist in the same directory it does, as 
		<em>QuickTimeSDK-7.3.</em> Be sure to install it accordingly when prompted by the installer. Your directories should look about like this:</p>

		<br>
				
		<p>If you are using one of our <a href="http://libcinder.org/download/">packaged releases</a>, you should be all set. However if you are building from our <a href="http://github.com/cinder/Cinder">Github repository</a> skip down to the <a href="#advanced">advanced section</a>.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Let's try opening and building one of the samples. From Windows Explorer, navigate to the <em>cinder\samples\QuickTime\vc9</em> folder and double-click <em>quickTimeSample.sln</em>.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Under the <em>Debug</em> menu select <em>Start Debugging</em> and click <em>Yes</em>
		when prompted to build the project. The QuickTime sample will launch
		and present you with an Open dialog. Select a QuickTime movie on your
		hard drive, and you should see something about like this:</p>

		<center><img alt="QuickTime sample" src="msw_images/quicktimesample.jpg"></center><br>

		<p>Especially as we continue to develop the documentation, the samples are the best
		way to get started learning Cinder. Don't be afraid to modify them and
		experiment. And if you haven't read Robert Hodgin's <em>Hello, Cinder</em> tutorial, you should go <a href="../docs/hello_cinder.html"> do that first</a>. </p>

		<h2><a name="advanced">Advanced - Building Cinder</a></h2>

		<p>If you are building Cinder from the source, available on our <a href="http://github.com/cinder/Cinder">Github repository</a>, you have just a couple of additional steps remaining. As an aside, if you are brand new to Cinder, you maybe happier just using one of our <a href="http://libcinder.org/download/">packaged releases</a>.</p>
		<br>

		<p>You'll want to grab the latest Boost, currently version 1.44, which you can 
		<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.44.0/boost_1_44_0.zip/download">download here</a>. 		After dearchiving it, you'll want to take the resulting directory and put it directly into your Cinder directory, and name it <em>boost</em>.</p>

		<br>

		<p>Everything look good? Let's try to build Cinder then. Open up the Visual Studio 
		solution in <em>cinder\vc9\cinder.sln.</em> Under the <em>Build</em> menu select 
		<em>Batch Build</em>, and click the checkboxes corresponding to both the 
		<em>Debug</em> and <em>Release</em> build configurations, and then hit the <em>Build</em> button.</p>

		<center><img style="width: 602px; height: 347px;" alt="Batch Build" src="msw_images/batchbuild.png"></center>
		<br>
		<p>This will take a second, but once everything succeeds, there should exist the 
		files <em>cinder.lib</em> and <em>cinder_d.lib</em> at the path <em>cinder\libs</em></p>
